The fitness world has been revolutionized by GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound). These drugs have shown remarkable weight loss results—15-21% in clinical trials. But there's a catch: **26-40% of weight lost comes from lean soft tissue**, including skeletal muscle.

For anyone who lifts or cares about their body composition, this is alarming. You didn't spend years building muscle just to watch it melt away while chasing fat loss. The good news? Emerging research shows you can preserve—or even *build*—muscle during GLP-1 therapy.

## The Muscle Loss Problem

In the landmark STEP 1 trial, participants on semaglutide lost 6.9 kg of lean soft tissue alongside 10.4 kg of fat. That's roughly **40% of total weight loss as muscle and connective tissue**. The SURMOUNT-1 trial with tirzepatide showed slightly better results—26% of weight loss as lean tissue—but still significant.

This matters for several reasons:

1. **Metabolic rate**: Muscle is metabolically active tissue. Losing it slows your metabolism, making long-term weight maintenance harder.
2. **Strength and function**: Lean mass loss means reduced strength, mobility, and independence.
3. **Aesthetics**: The "skinny fat" look—low weight but poor body composition—is unappealing and unhealthy.
4. **Health outcomes**: Preserving muscle is linked to better metabolic health, insulin sensitivity, and longevity.

## The Case for Resistance Training

A groundbreaking case series published in 2026 followed three patients using GLP-1 medications who implemented structured lifestyle strategies to preserve lean tissue. The results were striking:

- **Case 1**: 33% weight loss, but only 6.9% lean tissue loss (much better than the expected 26-40%)
- **Case 2**: 26.8% weight loss, but **gained 2.5% lean soft tissue**
- **Case 3**: 13.2% weight loss, but **gained 5.8% lean soft tissue**

What did these successful cases have in common?

- **Resistance training 3-5 days per week**
- **Exercise 4-7 days per week total** (including cardio)
- **Protein intake of 1.6-2.3 g/kg of fat-free mass**

This translates to roughly 120-180g protein daily for someone with moderate body fat. The patients who gained muscle weren't just maintaining—they were actively building while losing fat.

## The Protein Threshold

Research consistently shows that during weight loss, protein requirements increase. The traditional 0.8 g/kg recommendation is insufficient for muscle preservation during caloric deficit—especially when that deficit is chemically induced.

Studies suggest **1.6-2.2 g/kg of fat-free mass** (not total body weight) is optimal during GLP-1 therapy. For a 90 kg male with 25% body fat, that's approximately 108-149g protein daily.

Timing also matters. Spreading protein across 4-5 meals, with ~30-40g per serving, maximizes muscle protein synthesis (MPS) throughout the day.

## The Myostatin Solution: New Drug Combinations

In late 2025, researchers announced a potentially game-changing combination: **semaglutide plus trevogrumab** (an anti-myostatin antibody).

Myostatin is a protein that naturally limits muscle growth. By blocking it, you remove the "brakes" on muscle building. The BELIEVE study found that this combination:

- Prevented approximately **50% of the lean mass loss** typically seen with GLP-1 therapy alone
- Increased fat loss compared to GLP-1 alone
- Showed no significant safety concerns

Bimagrumab, another myostatin inhibitor, showed similar results in combination with semaglutide—participants gained 3.6% lean body mass while losing 20.5% fat mass.

These combinations are likely to become standard of care for patients concerned about muscle preservation.

## Training Strategies for GLP-1 Users

If you're using or considering GLP-1 medication, here's how to protect your muscle:

### 1. Prioritize Progressive Overload

Continue (or start) a structured resistance training program. The principles don't change: progressive overload drives hypertrophy regardless of your medication status.

### 2. Train to Failure (Occasionally)

Research confirms that proximity to failure matters more than load for hypertrophy. During weight loss, slightly higher proximity to failure can help maintain muscle activation.

### 3. Focus on Lengthened Partial Reps

The stretched position under load is particularly effective for muscle growth. During caloric deficit, emphasizing lengthened partials (bottom-of-range squats, paused bench, deep curls) can provide extra hypertrophic stimulus.

### 4. Don't Abandon Compound Movements

Squats, deadlifts, presses, and rows should remain the foundation. These multi-joint movements recruit the most muscle mass and preserve functional strength.

### 5. Add Strategic Cardio

Moderate cardio supports cardiovascular health without excessive calorie burn. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) may be particularly beneficial for maintaining metabolic rate.

## The Bottom Line

GLP-1 medications are incredibly effective for fat loss, but muscle preservation requires intentional action. The research is clear:

- **Resistance training is non-negotiable** for maintaining lean tissue
- **Protein intake must increase** to 1.6-2.3 g/kg fat-free mass
- **New drug combinations** (GLP-1 + myostatin inhibitors) show promise for preserving muscle
- **Some individuals can actually build muscle** while losing fat with the right approach

If you're using GLP-1 medications, treat your training and nutrition as seriously as your medication protocol. The drugs do the heavy lifting on fat loss—you still have to do the heavy lifting in the gym.
