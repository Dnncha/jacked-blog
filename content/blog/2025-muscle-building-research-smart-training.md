The fitness industry loves dogma. More sets. More weight. More supplements. More everything. But 2025 research is turning that mindset on its head. Multiple landmark studies published this year reveal a surprising truth: when it comes to building muscle, less might actually be more.

## The Schoenfeld Finding: Intensity Isn't Everything

Professor Brad Schoenfeld's research published in the *Journal of Applied Physiology* (January 2025) delivered a bombshell conclusion: **muscle growth can be achieved without continually increasing training intensity** [56].

For decades, progressive overload has been presented as non-negotiable—you must add weight, reps, or volume every week or stall. But Schoenfeld's findings suggest this pressure may be unnecessary. When lifters train to volitional fatigue, muscle growth occurs even when intensity plateaus.

### What This Means for You

- **Periodization gains scientific support**: Alternating between higher and lower intensity phases isn't just for powerlifters anymore—it's optimal for hypertrophy
- **Deload weeks work**: Intentional reduction in training stress helps maintain long-term muscle-building capacity
- **Sustainable progress**: Constant intensity progression burns out lifters both physically and mentally

The key insight isn't to stop progressing—it's that progression can come in many forms: proximity to failure, time under tension, exercise variation, or simply training consistency over time.

## Florida Atlantic University: The Volume Truth

A comprehensive meta-regression analysis from Florida Atlantic University, also published in early 2025, examined how training volume per session influences muscle growth and strength gains [63]. The findings challenge the "more is better" mentality that dominates gym culture.

### Direct vs. Indirect Sets

The researchers introduced an important distinction:

- **Direct sets**: Exercises that directly target a muscle group (e.g., bench press for chest)
- **Indirect sets**: Exercises that work a muscle secondarily (e.g., triceps extensions for chest development)

This nuance matters because previous volume recommendations may have counted indirect work twice, inflating perceived volume requirements.

### The Diminishing Returns Reality

The study found that **benefits plateau much faster than previously believed** [63]:

| Goal | Optimal Weekly Sets | Beyond This Point |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Strength | 4-8 sets per muscle group | Minimal additional benefit |
| Muscle Growth | 8-12 sets per muscle group | Rapidly diminishing returns |

For natural lifters, pushing beyond 12-15 sets per muscle group per week likely produces negligible additional growth while increasing injury risk and recovery demands.

### Practical Applications

- **Quality over quantity**: Effective muscular stimulation matters more than total set count
- **Train smarter**: Shorter, more focused sessions can match or exceed longer, sprawling workouts
- **Individual variation exists**: Some lifters thrive on higher volume, but general principles hold for most

## Proximity to Failure: Different Rules for Different Goals

Florida Atlantic University's 2024 research (published in early 2025 discussions) provided crucial clarity on how close you should train to failure [58]:

### The Key Findings

- **For hypertrophy**: Training closer to failure (0-3 reps in reserve) produces superior muscle growth
- **For strength**: How close you push to failure matters less—stopping 3-5 reps short still drives strength gains effectively

This separation is practical: you can manage fatigue differently depending on your primary goal. Strength training allows greater recovery with submaximal efforts, while hypertrophy training demands more from the muscle but can use lower loads when taken to true failure.

### The Load Paradox

Research confirms an important nuance: **as long as resistance training is performed to volitional fatigue, load might not significantly affect muscle growth** [61]. However:

- Low-load protocols require approximately 3× more training volume to match high-load results
- If not training to failure, loads above 60% of 1RM appear necessary for maximizing hypertrophy
- High-load training produces roughly twice the muscle thickness per set compared to low-load

### Training Recommendations by Goal

| Goal | Proximity to Failure | Load | Weekly Volume |
|------|---------------------|------|---------------|
| Muscle | 0-3 RIR | 60-85% 1RM | 8-12 sets |
| Strength | 3-5 RIR | 70-95% 1RM | 4-8 sets |

## The Creatine Conundrum: UNSW Study Challenges Conventional Wisdom

Perhaps the most controversial finding comes from a rigorously designed UNSW study published in *Nutrients* (March 2025) [60].

### Study Design

- 54 participants completed a 12-week resistance training program
- Randomized control trial with placebo group
- 5 grams daily creatine (standard dose)
- One-week "wash-in" period before measurements—addressing a methodological flaw in previous research
- Three supervised resistance training sessions per week

### The Surprising Results

**Both groups gained an average of 2 kg of lean body mass—with no significant difference between them** [60].

The creatine group did experience temporary weight gain, likely from water retention, but this didn't translate to more muscle. Previous studies may have overstated creatine's benefits due to methodological issues, particularly the lack of a wash-in period.

### Expert Interpretation

Dr. Mandy Hagstrom, lead researcher, stated: "Taking five grams of creatine supplement per day does not make any difference to the amount of lean muscle mass people put on while resistance training" [60].

Dr. Imtiaz Desai added: "For your average person taking creatine to boost their gains in the gym, this will hopefully change their perception about what it can help them achieve" [60].

### Practical Implications

- **For casual lifters**: Creatine won't dramatically enhance muscle gains beyond what training provides
- **For strength athletes**: The strength benefits may be more relevant than hypertrophy effects
- **Cost-benefit analysis**: Question whether supplement spending delivers proportional returns
- **Focus on fundamentals**: Training and nutrition quality matters far more than supplementation

## The 2025 Synthesis: Training Smarter

These studies converge on a unified message: **the era of extremes is ending**. Optimal muscle building in 2025 and beyond looks like:

1. **Moderate volume**: 8-12 challenging sets per muscle group weekly
2. **Train to failure for hypertrophy**: 0-3 reps in reserve on most working sets
3. **Strategic intensity**: Progress through periodization, not constant increases
4. **Smart supplementation**: Don't expect supplements to compensate for training gaps
5. **Sustainable approach**: Long-term consistency beats short-term intensity

The new paradigm isn't about doing less—it's about doing what's effective and ditching the rest. Your muscles don't care about your ego. They respond to stimulus, recovery, and consistency.

Train smart.
